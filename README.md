iCloud Keychain is an incredibly useful feature for Apple users that provides a secure and convenient way to manage passwords and other sensitive information. With iCloud Keychain, you can store your login credentials, credit card information, Wi-Fi passwords, and other important data securely on your Apple devices.

One of the advantages of using iCloud Keychain is that it eliminates the need to remember complex passwords for every website and app you use. Instead, you can rely on the password manager to generate strong, unique passwords that are automatically saved and synced across all your devices. This means that you can easily access your accounts from any Apple device without having to type in your login information every time.

Another key benefit of iCloud Keychain is that it offers end-to-end encryption to protect your data from unauthorized access. This means that your passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted on your device and can only be decrypted by other trusted devices that are signed in to your iCloud account.

In addition to encryption, iCloud Keychain also supports biometric authentication, which means that you can use Touch ID or Face ID to unlock your passwords and other information. This adds an extra layer of security to your data, making it much more difficult for anyone to access your accounts without your permission.

Overall, iCloud Keychain is an incredibly powerful tool that makes it easy to manage your passwords and other sensitive information securely across all your Apple devices. If you're not already using it, you should definitely consider turning it on to take advantage of its many benefits.

## The benefits of using iCloud Keychain

Apple has made significant strides in enhancing its password management capabilities with the introduction of new features in iOS 15, macOS Monterey, and beyond. In the past, iCloud Keychain was a somewhat passive password manager that would occasionally pop up unexpectedly to suggest strong passwords or autofill information, leaving users confused. However, with the latest updates, iCloud Keychain has become more proactive and now scans for potential password breaches, alerts users to repeated passwords, and even enables two-factor authentication (2FA).

## A Shortcut to access Passwords in a quick way

Using a password manager is essential in today's digital age. With so many accounts to keep track of, it's easy to fall into the trap of using the same password across multiple accounts or using weak passwords that are easy to guess. Apple has made it easy for users to manage their passwords by providing a built-in password manager that syncs across all Apple devices.

To access the password manager on your Apple device, navigate to Settings or System Preferences, depending on which OS you are using. However, having to navigate to this location every time you want to manage your passwords can be time-consuming.

With a simple shortcut, you'll be able to easily access to your passwords with a single tap from your home screen in iOS and iPadOS or in the menu bar in macOS. [Download the shortcut here][passwords-shortcut].
<br/><br/>

<p align="center"><a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/55b7b70717304c70bc8c0a12a835553b"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/keyave/assets/48920263/0a3b323f-0214-439a-b011-a669130d9d3e" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Download Shortcut" title="Download Shortcut" width="600px" /></a></p><br/>

## Manage passwords in the terminal

### How to set Touch ID in the macOS's Terminal

Macs have a fingerprint scanner (Touch ID) to simplify the login process. iCloud Keychain works best when you leverage Apple’s biometric system to make filling passwords quick and easy. Then you won’t need to type your Apple ID password or passcode whenever you need to fill in a field, but this is not activated by default in the terminal, which means that when you run programs with security privileges, you need to type the password.
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<p align="center"><a href="#"><img src="https://github.com/nicolodiamante/keyave/assets/48920263/33838fb7-028a-498f-bca8-b6a4a82cec7b" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Use Touch ID in Terminal" title="Use Touch ID in Terminal" width="500px" /></a></p><br/><br/><br/>

The following change will allow you to use Touch ID for authentication.

Open the Terminal application on your Mac and edit the file below:

```shell
nano /etc/pam.d/sudo
```

Add the following line to the top of the file:

```shell
auth sufficient pam_tid.so
```

Save and exit the file.

Now, when you use the `sudo` command in the terminal you should be prompted to use Touch ID instead of typing in your password. This can save time and add an extra layer of security to your system.

<br/>

### How to set Touch ID in iTerm

In Apple's default terminal it works like a charm, but in iTerm2 it needs additional configuration.

Go to Prefs <a href="#"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48920263/113451325-0df5f380-9402-11eb-80ea-cf4140340ab4.png" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Advanced <a href="#"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48920263/113451325-0df5f380-9402-11eb-80ea-cf4140340ab4.png" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Allow sessions to survive logging out and back in <a href="#"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48920263/113451325-0df5f380-9402-11eb-80ea-cf4140340ab4.png" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Set the value to no <a href="#"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48920263/113451325-0df5f380-9402-11eb-80ea-cf4140340ab4.png" draggable="false" ondragstart="return false;" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow" width="5.4px" /></a> Restart iTerm.
<br/><br/>

### Dealing with Touch ID when docked

To ensure that Touch ID is prompted instead of typing in a password when the computer is plugged in, you can use the following command in the Terminal:

```shell
defaults write com.apple.security.authorization ignoreArd -bool TRUE
```

This command enables the "auto unlock" feature on your Mac, which allows you to use Touch ID to authenticate actions that require administrator privileges, such as installing software or changing system settings, without having to type in your password. By default, this feature is only available when your Mac is in close proximity to your Apple Watch, but the above command extends it to when your Mac is plugged in with a dock.
<br/><br/>

## Access your iCloud passwords with Chrome on Windows

iCloud may be Apple’s thing, but you can still get your passwords even if you have an iPhone and a PC. You’ll need to [download iCloud for Windows][icloud-windows] first and ensure it’s updated to the latest version. Then you’ll need to grab the [iCloud Passwords extension in the Chrome store][chrome-windows] and sign in to turn on both. Once you enter your verification code, you can grab passwords from your iCloud Keychain when visiting a site in Chrome on your PC, just as if you were using Safari on your Mac.
