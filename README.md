iCloud Keychain is an incredibly useful feature for Apple users that provides a secure and convenient way to manage passwords and other sensitive information. With iCloud Keychain, you can store your login credentials, credit card information, Wi-Fi passwords, and other important data securely on your Apple devices.

One of the advantages of using iCloud Keychain is that it eliminates the need to remember complex passwords for every website and app you use. Instead, you can rely on the password manager to generate strong, unique passwords that are automatically saved and synced across all your devices. This means that you can easily access your accounts from any Apple device without having to type in your login information every time.

Another key benefit of iCloud Keychain is that it offers end-to-end encryption to protect your data from unauthorised access. This means that your passwords and other sensitive information are encrypted on your device and can only be decrypted by other trusted devices that are signed in to your iCloud account.

In addition to encryption, iCloud Keychain also supports biometric authentication, which means that you can use Touch ID or Face ID to unlock your passwords and other information. This adds an extra layer of security to your data, making it much more difficult for anyone to access your accounts without your permission.

Overall, iCloud Keychain is an incredibly powerful tool that makes it easy to manage your passwords and other sensitive information securely across all your Apple devices. If you're not already using it, you should consider turning it on to take advantage of its many benefits.

## The benefits of using iCloud Keychain

Apple has made significant strides in enhancing its password management capabilities with the introduction of new features in iOS 15, macOS Monterey, and beyond. In the past, iCloud Keychain was a somewhat passive password manager that would occasionally pop up unexpectedly to suggest strong passwords or autofill information, leaving users confused. However, with the latest updates, iCloud Keychain has become more proactive and now scans for potential password breaches, alerts users to repeated passwords, and even enables two-factor authentication (2FA).

## A Shortcut to access Passwords in a quick way

Using a password manager is essential in today's digital age. With so many accounts to keep track of, it's easy to fall into the trap of using the same password across multiple accounts or using weak passwords that are easy to guess. Apple has made it easy for users to manage their passwords by providing a built-in password manager that syncs across all Apple devices.

To access the password manager on your Apple device, navigate to Settings or System Preferences, depending on which OS you are using. However, having to navigate to this location every time you want to manage your passwords can be time-consuming.

### Manage passwords in the terminal

Macs have a fingerprint scanner (Touch ID) to simplify the login process. iCloud Keychain works best when you leverage Apple’s biometric system to make filling passwords quick and easy. Then you won’t need to type your Apple ID password or passcode whenever you need to fill in a field, but this is not activated by default in the terminal, which means that when you run programs with security privileges, you need to type the password.

<br><br>

Access your passwords swiftly and conveniently with a straightforward shortcut. For iOS and iPadOS users, this means a single tap from your home screen, while macOS users can find it readily in the menu bar or by pressing `⇧⌘P`. To get started, you can directly download the shortcut [here][passwords-shortcut]. Alternatively, you can follow the provided instructions to download and execute a script. This script not only downloads the shortcut for you but also configures your terminal environment to use Touch ID, streamlining your authentication process significantly.

## Getting Started

Keyave is a script designed to automate the setup of Touch ID authentication for terminal operations on Mac, replacing the need for password entry. Choose from two methods for installation:

**Automatic Download via `curl`**: Simply execute the following command in your terminal to quickly download and seamlessly install the utility:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicolodiamante/keyave/HEAD/bootstrap.sh)"
```

**Manual Cloning**: For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can manually clone the repository to your desired location (`~/keyave` in this case):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nicolodiamante/keyave.git ~/keyave
```

<br>

### Post-Download Steps

**Directory Navigation & Script Execution**: Navigate to the repository's `utils` directory and execute the installation script:

```shell
source install.sh
```

The script begins by checking your Mac's compatibility with Touch ID. If compatible, it provides the option to enable Touch ID for sudo commands, allowing for fingerprint-based authentication. Additionally, it features an option for automatic unlocking when the Mac is docked. These enhancements are specifically tailored to be applicable only on Mac models that support Touch ID, ensuring broad compatibility.

This streamlined approach not only simplifies the authentication process but also enhances security and user experience on macOS.

## Final Thoughts

Apple's iCloud Keychain, integrated seamlessly into macOS menus and apps, stands out as an accessible and straightforward password management solution, particularly for casual users or families seeking ease of use. Beyond just storing passwords, iCloud Keychain extends its capabilities to encompass credit card details and other sensitive data, securely syncing across Apple devices. Enhanced by end-to-end encryption and biometric authentication, it not only offers a cost-effective option for secure login management but also stays proactive in scanning for potential password breaches. Recent updates have further enriched its functionality, allowing even third-party apps to utilize its secure storage features. This combination of user-friendly interface, advanced security measures, and comprehensive coverage makes iCloud Keychain a noteworthy choice in the realm of password managers.

### Access your iCloud passwords with Chrome on Windows

iCloud may be Apple’s thing, but you can still get your passwords even if you have an iPhone and a PC. You’ll need to [download iCloud for Windows][icloud-windows] first and ensure it’s updated to the latest version. Then you’ll need to grab the [iCloud Passwords extension in the Chrome store][chrome-windows] and sign in to turn on both. Once you enter your verification code, you can grab passwords from your iCloud Keychain when visiting a site in Chrome on your PC, just as if you were using Safari on your Mac.
